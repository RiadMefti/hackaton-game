## 💡Inspiration
Our game, "Quack Attack," draws its inspiration from the simple, everyday reality of the University of Waterloo campus, which is notably populated with a large number of geese. These geese are infamous for their pervasive presence and the considerable amount of mess they create ( a lot of poop) . This unique aspect of campus life sparked the initial idea for our game.

## 🔍What it does
"Quack Attack" is an engaging top-down 2D shooter where the objective is simple : survive infinite waves of goose attacks. Players navigate through an endless level packed with increasingly aggressive geese. The goal is to eliminate as many geese as possible to achieve the highest score.

## ⚙️How we built it
We developed "Quack Attack" using the Godot Engine, an open-source game development platform(with GDScript). All the artwork in the game, from character designs to the environment, was created in-house by our team, giving it a unique and personal touch.

## 🚧Challenges we ran into
As this was our first foray into game development, we faced several challenges. Learning the ins and outs of Godot, understanding game physics, and creating the artwork from scratch were significant hurdles. Balancing the gameplay to be challenging yet enjoyable also required a lot of trial and error.

## ✔️Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are particularly proud of how we managed to learn and apply new skills in game development. Seeing our ideas transform into a playable game was incredibly rewarding. The fact that we created all the art ourselves adds a level of accomplishment to our project.

## 📚What we learned
This project was a deep dive into the world of game development. We learned not just the technical aspects of using Godot, but also about game design principles, artwork creation and animation.

## 🔭What's next for Quack Attack
The future of "Quack Attack" includes expanding the game with more levels, introducing new types of enemies, and possibly adding multiplayer functionality.
